Test Explenation:
The test is simple, it first navigates to the login page and fills in username and password inputs
afterwards it clicks the login button and user gets redirected to the form page.
On form page test fills the form, it sets title, initial, first and middle name to a given value and then clicks the save button.
Impressions:
As I did already work with web scraping I was used to finding the specific elements from the html file it's very similar only difference being that now the test is simulating physical clicks on the page while before I was just sending api requests. There was nothing overly complex I didn't understand it was pretty simple.
